# Epic 4: Performance Comparison System - Summary

This epic focused on building a performance comparison system to compare and rank different trading strategies. The following user stories were implemented:

*   **US-4.1: Compare multiple strategies:** The `scripts/compare_strategies.py` script was created to compare the performance of multiple strategies. This script takes a list of backtest result files as input and generates a comparison report.

*   **US-4.2: Strategy ranking:** The `scripts/compare_strategies.py` script was updated to rank strategies based on a composite score. The composite score is a weighted average of the metrics.
