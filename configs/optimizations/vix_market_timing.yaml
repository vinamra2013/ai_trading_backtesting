# Expected performance
success_criteria:
  min_trades: 10          # Low frequency - only on VIX spikes
  min_sharpe: 1.5         # Highest target - buying dips works well
  max_drawdown: 0.15      # 15% max drawdown
  min_win_rate: 0.65      # 65%+ win rate (dips recover)

# Fee considerations for $1K capital
fee_assumptions:
  per_trade_fee: 1.0      # Interactive Brokers: $1 per trade
  expected_trades_per_year: 10
  annual_fee_impact: 0.01  # ~1% of capital per year

# Strategy notes
notes:
  - "VIX is fear index - inversely correlated with SPY"
  - "Buy when VIX high (fear spike) = buy the dip"
  - "Exit when VIX normalizes (fear subsides)"
  - "VIX not directly tradable - SPY is trading vehicle"
  - "Low frequency reduces fee impact"
  - "Works well in volatile markets (2020, 2022)"
  - "Position sizing controls risk exposure"
